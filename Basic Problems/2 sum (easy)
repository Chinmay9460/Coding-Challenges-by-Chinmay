Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?


Observations --> 1.) There can be 3 ways to solve this problem -->

1.) Naive solution --> Just simple 2 loops impolementation.............
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for(int i = 0;i<nums.size();i++){
            for(int j = i+1;j<nums.size();j++){
                if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target)return {i,j};
            }
        }
        return {-1,-1};
    }
};


2.) Better Solution --> Using HashMap I can save the indexes of elements and find the element and return the index of that element.
