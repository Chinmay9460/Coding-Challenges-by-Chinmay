Quadratic Equation Roots
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 12.78%Submissions: 239K+Points: 1
Given a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, find its roots. If the roots are imaginary, return only one integer -1. Always return the roots as the greatest integers less than or equal to the actual roots, with the maximum root first followed by the minimum root.

Note: If roots are imaginary, the generated output will display "Imaginary".

Examples:

Input:
a = 1, b = -2, c = 1
Output: 1 1
Explanation:
Roots of equation x2-2x+1 are 1 and 1.
Input:
a = 1, b = -7, c = 12
Output: 4 3
Explanation: Roots of equation x2 - 7x + 12 are 4 and 3.

Code --> 
  class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> quadraticRoots(int a, int b, int c) {
       double D = sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c);
       if(D>=0){
           double d = (floor((-b+D)/(2.0*a)));
           double e = (floor((-b-D)/(2.0*a)));
           if(d>=e){
               return {d,e};
           }
           else{
               return {e,d};
           }
       }
       return {-1};
   }
