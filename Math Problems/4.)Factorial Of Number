Given a positive integer N. The task is to find factorial of N.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output: 24
Explanation: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
Example 2:

Input:
N = 13
Output: 6227020800
Explanation: 
13! = 13 * 12 * .. * 1 = 6227020800
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function factorial() that takes N as parameter and returns factorial of N.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 18

#Note --> there can be multiple ways to this problem --> 
1.) Recursive solution (Brute) 
class Solution{
    public:
        // Complete this function
    long long factorial(int N) {
        if(N == 1)return 1;
        return N * factorial(N-1);
    }
};
