/*
This is a classic problem that seems tricky at first due to the size of n (up to 10‚Åπ), 
but the key is to navigate a virtual lexicographical tree (prefix tree / trie) rather 
than actually sorting or storing all values.


Imagine all numbers from 1 to n are organized in lexicographical order, like a tree:

        ""
     /  |  \  ...
    1   2   3  ...
   /|\  |
 10 11 12...
